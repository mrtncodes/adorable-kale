      * Code signing


      We sign your desktop app with EV Microsoft Authenticode and Apple
      Gatekeeper certificates. Code signing is super-important because your app
      downloads and installs without warning dialogs.


      * Auto updates


      Your app will regularly auto-update to ensure the underlying browser is
      always up to date. Plus, this is how we deliver performance improvements,
      security patches, and additional features to your app.


      * Native installers


      You'll get a customised installer for Windows, Mac and Linux. We even
      provide a magic link you can send your users which will detect their
      operating system and download the most up to date version of your app.
