        content: >-
          With one simple command your app is published and ready for
          distribution on Windows, Mac and Linux. Your app is built with native
          installers, auto-updates, code signing and crash reports baked-in.


          There's no infrastructure to set-up, no servers to manage and no
          configuration needed.

          ToDesktop enables you to do a staggered released of your desktop app.
          This means you can test your app with a safe set of beta users before
          rolling it out completely.
